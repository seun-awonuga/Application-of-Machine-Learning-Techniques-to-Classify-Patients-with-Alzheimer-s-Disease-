# Project Summary
This research will evaluate the efficiency of supervised and unsupervised learning methods in categorizing patients with Healthy Control (HC) and non-HC diagnosis, which is Alzheimer’s Disease

# Dataset Description
- The dataset was acquired by researchers from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). It was based on the studies of Ageing data related to Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle
- The dataset was collected for the purpose of applying ML algorithms to effectively categorize three diagnostic results -
  healthy control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
- using a patient’s health assessment and medical history
